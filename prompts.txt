create  a vite project in this directory with three.js

for now, create a plane, make the color configurable in a config file.

Please only use JavaScript, not TypeScript

-------------------

Disable camera movement
Make the plane long and stretch it far from the camera to infinity. make the width configurable
Then position the camera like 30 degrees from the bottom of the plane, looking a bit downwards.

-------------------

Add a menu now, saying "Subsurf" with the option to play and settings option

The title should be white, (configurable)

Play button green
Setting button blue

-------------------

I want you to add large blocks in different colors to the right and left of the plane. They should not all be just beside the plane, but with a little variation in distance, so that they are not all uniform. Also the height of the blocks, as well as the width.
but they should all touch eachother.
Those are going to be the houses

-------------------

Add a plane below the current one, streching into the x space as well, so that it goes under the houses. make it another color, like green

-------------------

I now want you to add three detailed train tracks onto the large slim plane, that scretches across the screen.

-------------------

can you add the wodden planks as well?

-------------------

can you split up the logic into multiple files?

-------------------

Add a character now (bean), with configurable movement. It should only be able to switch between the three tracks

-------------------

I cannot see the caracter now, the camera might be in front of it

-------------------

There is an animation issue, when in the middle lane and switching to the right, the animation starts from the left track and goes to the middle. It should be from the right track to the middle

-------------------

There are a few bugs

1. The planks below the tracks, start after like 1 minute after pressing start, not from the start

2. The camera now starts behind the plane and sees the void behind it.

3. The buildings and the plane should not stop generating, as well as the tracks

-------------------

I had to adjust it to 500 to fix the planks

Also the houses are generating again, but there is a huge gap from the initial houses to the new ones. Also the track stops at that point as well

-------------------

Can you remove the jumping animation, and make the bean stand upright, like a player
He should switch the lanes (tracks) smoothly

Also enable playing with A and D

-------------------

The houses are still bugged, they don´t start generating again, just after they stopped. Also the track

Maybe you need to completely rework the generation

-------------------

The tracks are not generated directly from the beginning

-------------------

The tracks now start from the beginning, but not the woodden planks

-------------------

still not starting from the beginning

-------------------

Can you completely rework the rails? Remove all the code, then write new code

Seems like you can´t get the generation to work, start from behind the initial player position with the rails, so that they start from the beginning for sure

-------------------

I want you to add some random generated coins on the track, that the player can collect. They should count towards a coin score, displayed on the top right of the screen.

-------------------

I now  need some trains with different lengths driving towards the player. They should end the game when the player touches them, except from above, where he can run on them

-------------------

It seems like the train tie spacing is not always used and the tracks are initially always closer together. Only after like some distance are they as they should.

-------------------

I have uploaded a title.png in my public folder, can you take this as the background image in my title screen? You can hide the title that currently shows, as it's included in the image. Please add a small box around the buttons with a transparent background.
